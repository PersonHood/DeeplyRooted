# Deeply Rooted

No stance is deeply rooted. It is all a matter of your time scale.

Over 5,005,500,000 years we start with a gap in the galaxy and end up with recognizable people making tools.

Over 5 years we start with a President dividing the People and end with another President reuniting the northern hemisphere.

Nothing written on parchment 250 years ago is without room for reinterpretation; is so deeply rooted in history without showing its age.
