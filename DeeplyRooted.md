No stance is deeply rooted. It is all a matter of your time scale.

Over 5,005,500,000 years we start with a gap in the galaxy and end up with recognizable people making tools.

Over 55,000 years we start with people hunting and gathering food, with tools, and end up with civilizations and religions.

Over 550 years we start with Kings launching ships to explore the globe and end up with a President launching a rocket to explore the moon.

Over 5 years we start with a President dividing the People and end with another President reuniting the northern hemisphere.

Nothing written on parchment 250 years ago is without room for reinterpretation; is so deeply rooted in history without showing its age.
